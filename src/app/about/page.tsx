                Speak Arizona was created by Sara Mayer, then District Director
                of District 3 Toastmasters, alongside cohost
                Serban Mare. Their vision was simple: take the powerful
                conversations happening inside Toastmasters meetings and bring
                them to a wider audience — anyone in Arizona and beyond who
                wanted to become a better communicator and leader.

              <p className="text-text-light text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                When Sara and Serban moved on from the project, the podcast
                could have ended there.

                Rupesh Parbhoo stepped in as host and brought a new energy to
                the microphone. Under his leadership, Speak Arizona evolved from
                a district project into Arizona&apos;s only podcast dedicated to
                public speaking, communication, and leadership.

                The guests got bigger. The conversations got bolder. And the
                audience grew — because it turns out, people are hungry for
                honest, courageous conversations about what it really takes to
                find your voice and lead with purpose.

              <p className="text-text-light text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Rupesh Parbhoo is an Arizona-based speaker, podcast host, communication coach, and yoga instructor passionate about helping people lead, speak, and connect more authentically.
              </p>
              <p className="text-text-light text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                His path to communication started in 2017, working with engineers in Papua New Guinea. Their technical ability was outstanding, but Rupesh saw firsthand that technical skill alone wasn&apos;t enough — communication was what helped people build influence, create impact, and grow lasting careers. A local engineer introduced him to Toastmasters, and what began as something he encouraged others to do became an important part of his own leadership journey.
              </p>
              <p className="text-text-light text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                That perspective is also shaped by his work as a yoga instructor. Teaching yoga strengthened his ability to listen with intention, stay present, and connect beyond words — reinforcing the lesson that now defines his podcast: great communication is not about sounding perfect, but about being real.
              </p>
              <p className="text-text-light text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Through Speak Arizona, Rupesh creates space for meaningful conversations that help people become stronger communicators, more confident leaders, and more authentic versions of themselves.
